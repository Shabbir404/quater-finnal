                There are villages in most parts of our country full of greenery. Our villages are like green green
                land. The green nature of the village fills the hearts of the people with peace everywhere. The peaceful
                environment of the village removes all the fatigue of the people. The village is the lifeblood of this
                country.

                Our Shibpur village is very dear to us. The nature of this village is wrapped in Maya. The people of
                Shibpur are simple and hospitable. The beauty of Ichhamati river has made this village different from
                all other villages. People of all classes and professions live in harmony in Shibpur village.

            <h1 id="mikado-007"> Kawasaki Ninja H2 </h1>
            <small id="moric-bukhaili">This article is about the supercharged four-cylinder motorcycle announced in
                2014. For the 3-cylinder
                motorcycle of the 1970s, see Kawasaki H2 Mach IV.</small> <br><br>
            <hr>

            <p>The Kawasaki Ninja H2 is a "supercharged supersport" class[9] motorcycle in the Ninja sportbike series,
                manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, featuring a variable-speed centrifugal-type
                supercharger.[10][11][12][13] The track-only variant is called Ninja H2R, and it is the fastest and most
                powerful production motorcycle on the market; it produces a maximum of 310 horsepower (230 kW) and 326
                horsepower (243 kW) with ram air.[2] The H2R has 50% more power than the fastest street-legal
                motorcycles, while the street-legal Ninja H2 has a lower power output of 200 hp (150 kW)[14]â€“210 hp (160
                kW) with ram air.[2]

                Its namesake is the 750 cc Kawasaki H2 Mach IV,[15][16] an inline triple that was introduced by Kawasaki
                in 1972 to "disrupt what it saw as a sleeping motorcycle market".[17]</p>
